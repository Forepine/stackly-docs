# Team Members

Stackly allows you to collaborate with your team by adding members to your account. You can manage their roles, permissions, and access status directly from the dashboard.

## Managing Team Members

### ➕ Invite New Members

To add a new team member, you need to send them an invitation.

1. Navigate to **Team Members**.
2. Click **Add User**.
3. Enter the user's **Name** and **Email Address**.
4. Select a **Role** (Admin, Manager or Viewer).
5. Click **Send Invitation**.

The user will receive an email with an invitation link containing a secure token to join your team.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only invite users if your current plan has available user slots. If you have reached your limit, you will need to upgrade your subscription.

### 📋 List All Members

You can view a paginated list of all team members associated with your account. The list displays:
- Name
- Email
- Role
- Status (Active/Inactive)

### 🔄 Update Member Status

You can activate or deactivate team members to control their access without deleting their account.

- **Deactivate**: Temporarily suspends the user's access.

### ✏️ Update Profile

Users can update their own profile information.
