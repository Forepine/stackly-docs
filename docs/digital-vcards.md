# Digital vCards

Create stunning, interactive digital business cards that make networking effortless. Share your contact information, social media profiles, and custom links in one beautiful, mobile-friendly page.

## What is a Digital vCard?

A Digital vCard (also known as Bio Page) is your modern business card on the web. Instead of exchanging physical cards, share a single link that contains all your professional information. Visitors can save your contact details directly to their phone with one tap, and you get real-time analytics on who's viewing your card.
