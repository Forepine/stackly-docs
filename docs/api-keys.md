# API Keys

API Keys allow you to authenticate your applications and scripts with the Stackly API.

## Managing API Keys

### 🔑 Create a New Key

1. Go to **Settings** > **API Keys**.
2. Click **Generate New Key**.
3. Give your key a descriptive **Name** (e.g., "Website Integration").
4. Click **Create**.
5. **Copy the key immediately**. You will not be able to see it again.

### 📋 List Keys

View all your active API keys in the dashboard. You can see the key name, prefix, and creation date.

### 🔄 Regenerate a Key

If a key is compromised or you need to rotate your credentials:
1. Find the key in the list.
2. Click the **Revoke** or **Regenerate** icon.
3. Confirm the action.

> [!WARNING]
> Regenerating a key will immediately invalidate the old key value and generate a new one. You must update any applications using the old key with the new value to maintain access. The key entry itself (name, prefix) will remain.
