# Plans & Subscriptions

Choose the plan that fits your needs and scale your usage with flexible top-up options.

## Subscription Plans

Stackly offers both **Monthly** and **Yearly** subscription plans to give you access to premium features and higher usage limits.

### Plan Features
- **Monthly**: Flexible billing, cancel anytime.
- **Yearly**: Discounted rates for long-term commitment.

## Top-up Subscriptions

Need more clicks? You don't need to upgrade your entire plan. Stackly allows you to purchase **Top-up Subscriptions** to increase the click limits for specific services.

### How Top-ups Work
- **Targeted Increases**: Buy extra clicks specifically for Short URLs, Digital vCards, or other services.
- **Stackable**: You can purchase multiple top-ups if your needs grow.
- **Independent**: Top-ups work alongside your main subscription.

## Managing Your Subscription

You can view and manage your subscription details directly from the dashboard.

### Subscription Details
Navigate to **Settings** > **Billing** to see:
- **Status**: Current state of your subscription (e.g., Active, Cancelled).
- **Plan**: The name of your current plan.
- **Renewal Date**: When your subscription will automatically renew.
- **Usage Reset**: The date when your monthly usage limits will reset.
